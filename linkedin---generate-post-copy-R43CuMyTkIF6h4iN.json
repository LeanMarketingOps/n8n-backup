Objective (Purpose of the Post)**\n- Determine the business goal before writing. Choose one:\n  - *Audience Growth*: relatable story, challenge, or insight.\n  - *Lead Generation*: valuable free resource or offer.\n  - *Thought Leadership*: contrarian opinion, data-driven insight.\n  - *Community Building*: conversation-starter or relatable struggle.\n\n**2. Hook (The 2-Line Rule)**\n- *Line 1:* Scroll-stopping, bold, emotional, or pattern-interrupting.\n- *Line 2:* Creates curiosity or an open loop that compels readers to click “see more.”\n- Combine at least **two** of the four hook elements:\n  - Scar/Receipt (painful lesson)\n  - Specificity (numbers, nouns)\n  - Pattern Interrupt (unexpected truth)\n  - Worldview Stake (earned opinion)\n- Score at least 7/9 in uniqueness, clarity, and stakes.\n\n**3. Body (Deliver Value)**\n- Use one of these proven formats:\n  - Personal story → lesson learned.\n  - Educational / How-to → actionable insights.\n  - Contrarian / Opinion → challenge common belief.\n  - Inspirational → adversity or mindset shift.\n  - Lead magnet → resource or offer.\n- Structure:\n  - *Setup:* context or problem.\n  - *Conflict:* challenge, mistake, or friction.\n  - *Resolution:* solution, outcome, or key lesson.\n- Keep sentences short and easy to read.\n- Use single-sentence paragraphs for white space.\n- Write as if speaking to a peer over coffee.\n\n**4. Close (Call to Action)**\nEnd with a simple, clear CTA:\n- Ask a thought-provoking question.\n- Invite comments or shares.\n- Offer a resource (“Comment X to receive…”).\n- Encourage conversation (“What’s your take?”).\n\n**5. Final Polish**\nBefore returning your post:\n- Make sure the post passes the SM test (Scannable, Memorable, Shareable, Skin-in-the-game).\n- Ensure tone and structure align with the chosen objective.\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 FULL HIGH-PERFORMING EXAMPLES\n\nYou must emulate the tone and structure of the following high-performing examples:\n\n- Example 1: \"Hot take: Most COOs are just glorified project managers. Here's the blunt truth about why that’s a problem.\n\nThey're buried in Gantt charts, obsessed with sprint velocity, and live on Slack.\n\nThey're master coordinators.\n\nBut they aren't true operational leaders.\n\nThe problem is that while they're busy managing the work, no one is designing the system.\n\nSo the business can't scale.\n\nEvery new project just adds another layer of complexity.\n\nEvery new hire makes communication more chaotic.\n\nThe team gets burnt out, and the CEO gets frustrated because growth has hit a ceiling.\n\nI get it. It's easy to fall into the trap of just 'getting things done'.\n\nBut a real COO doesn't just manage projects. They build a machine.\n\nThey create systems that run themselves.\n\nThey empower their team to make decisions without them.\n\nAnd they focus on removing bottlenecks, not just tracking them.\n\nStop being a super-PM. Start being a strategic operator.\n\nIf you're a COO stuck in project management mode, what's the biggest bottleneck you're facing? \n\n#COO #Operations #TeamManagement #Leadership #ScaleUp\n\"\n\n- Example 2: \"At my recent Change the Game event, we hosted a cracker of a panel with Laura Cole, Daniel Hill and Matt Lakajev.\n\nThey discussed what recruiters need to focus on right now to win in BD to over 100 attendees, and it was insanely good.\n\nMatt’s coached over 1,500 professionals on how to win on LinkedIn. So I asked him:\n\n“Are there too many people trying to sell their services on the platform?”\n\nHis answer? “No.”\n\nThe issue isn’t too much selling.\n\nIt’s lazy content….and it's all too often not written by a human\n\nIf your content isn’t organic, consistent, and helping people, then it's just more noise.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\"\n- Example 3: \"Content will get you 0 clients on LinkedIn.\n\nThe only thing that matters is conversations.\n\nContent gets you seen.\nConversations get you paid.\n\nSimple.\n\nFeel free to disagree.\n\nBut DMs are 10x more important for $ than content.\n\"\n- Example 4: \"Get the training for FREE here - https://Inkd.in/gmRgauWF\n\nMy client gets 20 likes and 50 leads per post\n\nHonestly, I'm not f*cking with you…\n\nI just recorded a 104 min training with him\n\n- Comment TRAINING and I'll share it with you -\n\nWatch it for yourself lol.\n\nPrepare to have your mind\n\nPS - Likes # Leads\n\nYou LinkedIn Guru is full of bs...\n\"\n- Example 5: \"Here’s $10,000 worth of LinkedIn training.\n\nFor free.\n\nNo catch or upsell.\n\nJust 5 courses that show you exactly how I built my business on LinkedIn.\n\nAll I ask is you tag a friend in the Comments so they can get it too.\n\nHere's all 5 of them:\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟭 - https://lnkd.in/gAckNckG\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟮 - https://lnkd.in/giEFJN3i\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟯 - https://lnkd.in/gXKJ-vP7\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟰 - https://lnkd.in/gD5ykQyW\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟱 - https://lnkd.in/gKZ8DZ3C\n\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟭: Start Selling on LinkedIn - https://lnkd.in/gAckNckG\n\n• Find your superpower & ideal clients\n• Create a high-ticket offer that sells\n• Get my exact templates (Notion + Figma)\n• Start closing deals without ads\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟮: Write Content That Gets Leads - https://lnkd.in/giEFJN3i\n\n• Why 99% of content gets ignored\n• The hook formula that stops the scroll\n• How to write without “writing experience”\n• Make every post a lead magnet\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟯: Optimize Your Profile for Inbound - https://lnkd.in/gXKJ-vP7\n\n• The 6 elements that matter (everyone gets 2 wrong)\n• Write a headline that attracts ideal clients\n• Turn your profile into a 24/7 sales machine\n• Get leads while you sleep\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟰: Add 200+ Connections Weekly - https://lnkd.in/gD5ykQyW\n\n• Why you’re screwing up outreach\n• Build a warm leads list in 3 minutes\n• Get 90% response rates on DMs\n• Never feel desperate again\n\n𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟱: Write Content Without Overwhelm - https://lnkd.in/gKZ8DZ3C\n\n• Always have something to say\n• Make writing an extension of your work\n• My daily habit for endless ideas\n• The one hack that makes it easy\n\nTotal value: $10,000+ Your investment: $0\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nBecause I’m tired of watching experts struggle on LinkedIn when they should be thriving.\n\nYou don’t need another $47 course. You need implementation.\n\nThese aren’t teasers. They’re complete trainings with everything you need.\n\nBecause when you win, we all win.\n\nP.S. Yes, this is real. Yes, it’s actually free. No, there’s no catch. I make my money from high-ticket programs. This is how I give back.\n\nP.S.S. REPOST♻️ if you got value you LEGEND!\n\"\n- Example 6: \"Taki Moore's has made 650 people MILLIONAIRES\n\nAnd I just showed him how to use LinkedIn\n\nWe're also been mates since 2015\n\nAnd...\n\n→ I've presented for 90 mins 2x in his program\n→ I did a 45 min workshop with his 7+8 fig coaches\n→ And about 50+ of his clients are in my program :)\n\nAnd a couple of months back we chatted about it\n\nIn Coaches in Cars getting Coffees.\n\nCheck it out here - https://lnkd.in/gXTqkgrn\n\n\nPS - Don't know who Taki is?
