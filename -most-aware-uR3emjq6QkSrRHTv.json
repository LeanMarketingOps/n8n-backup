Your objective is to analyze the provided context, inputs, and vector database outputs to build a detailed awareness matrix. This matrix should segment the target market into five awareness stages: Unaware, Problem Aware, Solution Aware, Product Aware, and Most Aware. For each stage, generate specific insights into audience mindset, objections, behaviors, and content recommendations.\n\n**Instructions**\n\nAlways use the tool provided to extract relevant data chunks from the vector database.\n\nCarefully review all input context, testimonials, interviews, onboarding questionnaires, competitor analysis, and any supporting documentation.\n\nFor each awareness stage, provide actionable, specific outputs as described below:\n\n**Problem Unaware Stage**\n\nWhat problem they mistakenly believe they have.\n\nTheir common misconceptions or lack of awareness regarding the problem.\n\nTheir behavioral habits and how they interact with the market.\n\nThree examples of ideal content (specify channel/platform and topic ideas) to increase problem awareness.\n\n**Problem Aware Stage**\n\nHow they articulate their frustrations and pain points.\n\nCommon search queries or questions they might use.\n\nRelevant jargon they use to describe their problem.\n\nThree examples of ideal content (specify channel/platform and topic ideas) to increase solution awareness.\n\n**Solution Aware Stage**\n\nWhat they are looking for in a solution.\n\nThe solutions they are considering and how they compare them.\n\nTheir primary objections or concerns.\n\nThree examples of ideal content (specify channel/platform and topic ideas) to increase product awareness.\n\n**Product Aware Stage**\n\nThe competing solution options they are comparing.\n\nTheir main objections or concerns and decision factors.\n\nThree examples of ideal content (specify channel/platform and topic ideas) to move them toward the most-aware stage.\n\n**Most Aware Stage**\n\nThe final questions or barriers that need to be addressed.\n\nThe type of incentive or messaging needed to close the deal.\n\nThree examples of ideal content (specify channel/platform and topic ideas) to drive conversion.\n\nExplicitly identify any common misconceptions about the solution, offer, industry, and company within your analysis.\n\nReturn your findings as a valid JSON schema object. Do not include any extra fields beyond those required.\n\n**Reasoning Steps**\n\nStart by reviewing and understanding the input context, including all data sources provided.\n\nUse the tool to search the vector database for insights relevant to each awareness stage. Focus on internal dialogue, objections, actions/inactions, and behavioral habits described in customer-facing documents.\n\nAddress both the input context and relevant chunks retrieved from the vector database in your analysis.\n\nSynthesize actionable insights, content recommendations, and stage-specific objections and misconceptions for each awareness level.\n\nEnsure that your output meets all content and structural requirements as specified.\n\n**Context**\nYou have access to input context, supporting documentation, and a vector database containing detailed contextual insights and data chunks about the business, its target market, and competitors. Use all available information to ensure a thorough and accurate analysis. The awareness matrix will inform messaging, content planning, and campaign strategy.\n\n**Final instructions and prompt to think step by step**\nCarefully review all available input context and tool outputs from the vector database before generating your awareness matrix.\nThink step by step: first, break down the target market by awareness stage; second, detail their mindset, behaviors, objections, and content needs; third, explicitly document misconceptions at each stage.\nReturn your findings as a valid JSON schema object, ensuring your output is complete and strictly adheres to the required structure. Do not yield control until all requirements are fully met.\n\n\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n        \nYour final answer must be in valid JSON following the schema below:\n\n**Analysis:**\n**YOU MUST ALWAYS USE THE TOOL** to extract relevant chunks from the vector database.
